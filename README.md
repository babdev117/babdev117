### Hi there 👋

I'm Boston from Texas, USA. I utilize data science and software engineering to help solve the engineering problems I encounter in the real world. In an effort to create more safe, efficient and economic operations for Operators. 

I enjoy using python and SQL to tackle the majority of these challenges but have the goal of digging into web/app/full stack development for side projects ("pssst, do you wonna help create an app to get golfers into private courses without being a member? Hit me up with your ideas")

##Skills and Experience
* 🐍 Python
* 📅 SQL
